## Preprocessor

**Preprocessor** **--->** **Compiler** **--->** **Assembler** **--->** **Linker**  **--->** **Executable**



**Preprocessor performs**:

- `Inclusion of other files in the file being compiled`
- `Symbolic constants` - constants represented as symbols
- `Macros` - operations defined as symbols
- `Conditional compilation` 



**Preprocessor directives begin with #**
