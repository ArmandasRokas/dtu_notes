## Rest

### POJO

Plain old java object

### Serialization 

Means to convert an object into that string, and deserialization is its inverse operation

### JAX-RS 

Standardize the development of RESTfull web services using J2EE. These specifications are just the definitions and not the concrete implementation

### Jersey

Implements JAX-RS APIs 

### Jackson

Jersey uses Jackson internally to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa. That means JSON-mapper
